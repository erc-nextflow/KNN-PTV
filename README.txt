1: KNN: folder with all the tools to perform the KNN-PTV algorithm described in "An end-to-end KNN-based PIV approach for high-resolution measurements and uncertainty quantification",
Authors: I.Tirelli, A.Ianiro, S.Discetti.

2: PTV: simple PTV software that takes in input raw pictures and build the PTV snapshots ready to be copied in the KNN folder and used by the algorithm.

Instruction: if you need to compute the PTV from your images the first step is to open the folder PTV and follow the instruction there, otherwise you can go directly in KNN folder
