In this folder there are the settings for the algorithm, there are two files:

1) ConfigurationKNN_PTV: general configuration file for the algorithm
2) ConfigK: configuration file for the optimum K selection
			+
3) Example: example of configuration file that I used in the paper.

Instruction:

1) Open the .m file and fill the parameters following the examples.
